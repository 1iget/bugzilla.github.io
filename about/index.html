<h1>About Bugzilla</h1>

<h2>What is Bugzilla?</h2>

<p> Bugzilla is a robust, featureful and mature defect-tracking system, or
bug-tracking system. Defect-tracking systems allow teams of developers to
keep track of outstanding bugs, problems, issues, enhancement and other change
requests in their products effectively. Simple defect-tracking capabilities
are often built into integrated source code management environments such as
Github or other web-based or locally-installed equivalents. We find
organizations turning to Bugzilla when they outgrow the capabilities of
those systems - for example, because they want workflow management, or
bug visibility control (security), or custom fields.</p>

<p>Bugzilla is both free as in freedom and free as in price. Most commercial
defect-tracking software vendors charge enormous licensing fees.  Despite
being free, Bugzilla has <a href="../features/">many features</a> which are
lacking in both its expensive and its free counterparts. Consequently,
Bugzilla is used by
<a href="../installation-list/">hundreds or thousands of organizations</a>
across the globe.</p>

<p>Bugzilla is a web-based system but needs to be installed on your server
for you to use it. However, installation is not complex.</p>
