This website uses Github Pages and Jekyll.

A file needs to have YAML Front Matter to be processed by Jekyll (and so to
have e.g. the bugzilla.org wrapper applied). Front Matter looks like this at
the top of the file:

---
title: "My Title"
---

Other parameters can go between the three dashes. You can also have no
parameters if you just want to say "process this".
 
Jekyll's templating engine is Liquid. Reference:

Here are the available template variables:
