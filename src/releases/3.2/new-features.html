<h3><a name="v32_feat_ui"></a>Major UI Improvements</h3>

<p>Bugzilla 3.2 has had some UI assistance from the NASA
  Human-Computer Interaction department and the new 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:UE">Bugzilla
  User Interface Team</a>.</p>

<p>In particular, you will notice a massively redesigned bug
  editing form, in addition to our <a href="#v32_feat_skin">new skin</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_skin"></a>New Default Skin: Dusk</h3>

<p>Bugzilla 3.2 now ships with a skin called "Dusk" that is
  a bit more colorful than old default "Classic" skin.</p>

<p>Upgrading installations will still default to the "Classic" 
  skin--administrators can change the default in the Default Preferences
  control panel. Users can also choose to use the old skin in their
  Preferences (or using the View :: Page Style menu in Firefox).</p>

<p>The changes that Bugzilla required for Dusk made
  Bugzilla much easier to skin. See the
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Addons#Skins">Addons page</a>
  for additional skins, or try making your own!</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_status"></a>Custom Status Workflow</h3>

<p>You can now customize the list of statuses in Bugzilla,
  and transitions between them.</p>

<p>You can also specify that a comment must be made on certain transitions.</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_fields"></a>New Custom Field Types</h3>

<p>Bugzilla 3.2 has support for three new types of
  custom fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large Text: Adds a multi-line textbox to your bugs.</li>
  <li>Multiple Selection Box: Adds a box that allows you to choose
    multiple items from a list.</li>
  <li>Date/Time: Displays a date and time, along with a JavaScript
    calendar popup to make picking a date easier.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_install"></a>Easier Installation</h3>

<p>Bugzilla now comes with a script called 
  <kbd>install-module.pl</kbd> that can automatically download
  and install all of the required Perl modules for Bugzilla.
  It stores them in a directory inside your Bugzilla
  installation, so you can use it even if you don't have administrator-level
  access to your machine, and without modifying your main Perl install.</p>

<p><kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> will print out instructions for using
  <kbd>install-module.pl</kbd>, or you can read its
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.2/en/html/api/install-module.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_oracle"></a>Experimental Oracle Support</h3>

<p>Bugzilla 3.2 contains experimental support for using 
  Oracle as its database. Some features of Bugzilla are known 
  to be broken on Oracle, but hopefully will be working by our next major
  release.</p>

<p>The Bugzilla Project, as an open-source project, of course
  does not recommend the use of proprietary database solutions. However,
  if your organization requires that you use Oracle, this will allow
  you to use Bugzilla!</p>

<p>The Bugzilla Project thanks Oracle Corp. for their extensive
  development contributions to Bugzilla which allowed this to 
  happen!</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_utf8"></a>Improved UTF-8 Support</h3>

<p>Bugzilla 3.2 now has advanced UTF-8 support in its code,
  including correct handling for truncating and wrapping multi-byte
  languages. Major issues with multi-byte or unusual languages
  are now resolved, and Bugzilla should now be usable
  by users in every country with little (or at least much less)
  customization.</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_grcons"></a>Group Icons</h3>

<p>Administrators can now specify that users who are in certain groups
  should have an icon appear next to their name whenever they comment.
  This is particularly useful for distinguishing developers from 
  bug reporters.</p>

<h3><a name="v32_feat_other"></a>Other Enhancements and Changes</h3>

<p>These are either minor enhancements, or enhancements that have
  very short descriptions. Some of these are very useful, though!</p>

<h4>Enhancements For Users</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: You can now reassign
    a bug at the same time as you are changing its status.</li>
  <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: When entering a bug, 
    you will now see the description of a component when you select it.</li>
  <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: The bug view now 
    contains some <a href="http://microformats.org/about/">Microformats</a>,
    most notably for users' names and email addresses.</li>
  <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: You can now remove a QA Contact
    from a bug simply by clearing the QA Contact field.</li>
  <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: There is now a user preference 
    that will allow you to exclude the quoted text when replying 
    to comments.</li>
  <li><strong>Bugs</strong>: You can now expand or collapse
    individual comments in the bug view.</li>

  <li><strong>Attachments</strong>: There is now "mid-air collision" 
      protection when editing attachments.</li>
  <li><strong>Attachments</strong>: Patches in the Diff Viewer now show 
    line numbers (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=327546">Example</a>).</li>
  <li><strong>Attachments</strong>: After creating or updating an attachment,
    you will be immediately shown the bug that the attachment
    is on.</li>

  <li><strong>Search</strong>: You can now reverse the sort of 
    a bug list by clicking on a column header again.</li>
  <li><strong>Search</strong>: Atom feeds of bug lists now
    contain more fields.</li>
  <li><strong>Search</strong>: QuickSearch now supports searching flags
    and groups. It also now includes the OS field in the list of fields
    it searches by default.</li>
  <li><strong>Search</strong>: "Help" text can now appear on query.cgi 
    for Internet Explorer and other non-Firefox browsers. (It always
    could appear for Firefox.)</li>

  <li>Bugzilla now ships with an icon that will show
    up next to the URL in most browsers. If you want to replace it,
    it's in <kbd>images/favicon.ico</kbd>.</li>

  <li>You can now set the Deadline when using "Change Several 
    Bugs At Once"</li>
  <li><strong>Saved Searches</strong> now save their column list, so if 
    you customize the list of columns and save your search, it will 
    always contain those columns.</li>
  <li><strong>Saved Searches</strong>: When you share a search, you can
    now see how many users have subscribed to it, on 
    <kbd>userprefs.cgi</kbd>.</li>
  <li><strong>Saved Searches</strong>: You can now see what group a 
    shared search was shared to, on the list of available shared searches
    in <kbd>userprefs.cgi</kbd>.</li>
  <li><strong>Flags</strong>: If your installation uses drop-down user 
    lists, the flag requestee box will now contain only users who are 
    actually allowed to take requests.</li>
  <li><strong>Flags</strong>: If somebody makes a request to you, and you
    change the requestee to somebody else, the requester is no longer set
    to you. In other words, you can "redirect" requests and maintain the
    original requester.</li>
  <li><strong>Flags</strong>: Emails about flags now will thread properly
    in email clients to be a part of a bug's thread.</li>
  <li>When using <kbd>email_in.pl</kbd>, you can now add users to the CC
    list by just using <kbd>@cc</kbd> as the field name.</li>
  <li>Many pages (particularly administrative pages) now contain links to
    the relevant section of the Bugzilla Guide, so you can read 
    the documentation for that page.</li>
  <li>Dependency Graphs should render more quickly, as they now (by default)
    only include the same bugs that you'd see in the dependency
    tree.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Enhancements For Administrators</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Admin UI</strong>: Instead of having the Administration 
    Control Panel links in the footer, there is now just one link called 
   "Administration" that takes you to a page that links to all the
    administrative controls for Bugzilla.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin UI</strong>: Administrative pages no longer display
    confirmation pages, instead they redirect you to some useful page 
    and display a message about what changed.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin UI</strong>: The interface for editing group 
     inheritance in <kbd>editgroups.cgi</kbd> is much clearer now.</li>
  <li><strong>Admin UI</strong>: When editing a user, you can now see 
    all the components where that user is the Default Assignee or Default
    QA Contact.</li>

  <li><strong>Email</strong>: For installations that use SMTP to send 
    mail (as opposed to Sendmail), Bugzilla now supports
    SMTP Authentication, so that it can log in to your mail server 
    before sending messages.</li>
  <li><strong>Email</strong>: Using the "Test" mail delivery method now
     creates a valid mbox file to make testing easier.</li>

  <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Bugzilla now correctly 
    handles LDAP records which contain multiple email addresses. (The first
    email address in the list that is a valid Bugzilla account 
    will be used, or if this is a new user, the first email address in 
    the list will be used.)</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Bugzilla can now take 
    a list of LDAP servers to try in order until it gets a successful
    connection.</li>
  <li><strong>Authentication</strong>: Bugzilla now supports 
    RADIUS authentication.</li>

  <li><strong>Security</strong>: The login cookies is now created as 
    "HTTPOnly" so that it can't be read by possibly malicious scripts. 
    Also, if SSL is enabled on your installation, the login cookie is
    now only sent over SSL connections.</li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: The <code>ssl</code> parameter now protects
    every page a logged-in user accesses, when set to "authenticated sessions."
    Also, SSL is now enforced appropriately in the WebServices interface when
    the parameter is set.</li>

  <li><strong>Database</strong>: Bugzilla now uses transactions in 
    the database instead of table locks. This should generally improve
    performance with many concurrent users. It also means if there is
    an unexpected error in the middle of a page, all database changes made
    during that page will be rolled back.</li>
  <li><strong>Database</strong>: You no longer have to set 
    <code>max_packet_size</code> in MySQL to add large attachments. However,
    you may need to set it manually if you restore a mysqldump into your
    database.</li>

  <li>New WebService functions:
    <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.2/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService/Bug.html">B<!-- -->ug.add_comment</a>
    and <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.2/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService/Bugzilla.html">Bugzilla.extensions</a>.</li>

  <li>You can now delete custom fields, but only if they have never been
    set on any bug.</li>
  <li>There is now a <kbd>--reset-password</kbd> argument to 
    <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> that allows you to reset a user's password
    from the command line.</li>
  <li>There is now a script called <kbd>sanitycheck.pl</kbd> that you can
    run from the command line. It works just like <kbd>sanitycheck.cgi</kbd>.
    By default, it only outputs anything if there's an error, so it's
    ideal for administrators who want to run it nightly in a cron job.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>strict_isolation</kbd> parameter now prevents you from setting
    users who cannot see a bug as a CC, Assignee, or QA
    Contact. Previously it only prevented you from adding users who
    could not <em>edit</em> the bug.</li>
  <li>Extensions can now add their own headers to the HTML &lt;head&gt;
    for things like custom CSS and so on.</li>
  <li><kbd>sanitycheck.cgi</kbd> has been templatized, meaning that the
    entire Bugzilla UI is now contained in templates.</li>
  <li>When setting the <kbd>sslbase</kbd> parameter, you can now specify
    a port number in the URL.</li>
  <li>When importing bugs using <kbd>importxml.pl</kbd>,
    attachments will have their actual creator set as their creator,
    instead of the person who exported the bug from the other
    system.</li>
  <li>The voting system is off by default in new installs. This is to
    prepare for the fact that it will be moved into an extension at
    some point in the future.</li>
  <li>The <code>shutdownhtml</code> parameter now works even when Bugzilla's database server is down.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Enhancements for Localizers (or Localized Installations)</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The documentation can now be localized--in other words, you can have
    documentation installed for multiple languages at once and
    Bugzilla will link to the correct language in its internal
    documentation links.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla no longer uses the <kbd>languages</kbd> parameter.
    Instead it reads the <kbd>template/</kbd> directory to see which
    languages are available.</li>
  <li>Some of the messages printed by <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> can now
    be localized. See <kbd>template/en/default/setup/strings.txt.pl</kbd>.
</li></ul>
