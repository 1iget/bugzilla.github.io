Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* Everybody could search for time-tracking information, not just
  members of the timetrackinggroup.

* Under suexec, "localconfig" was world-readable, meaning that
  local users with shell access to the Bugzilla server may have
  been able to see the database password and the site_wide_secret.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Versions:    2.17.1 to 3.2.6, 3.3.1 to 3.4.6, 3.5.1 to 3.6, 3.7
Fixed In:    3.2.7, 3.4.7, 3.6.1, 3.7.1
Description: Normally, information about time-tracking (estimated
             hours, actual hours, hours worked, and deadlines) is
             restricted to users in the "time-tracking group".
             However, any user was able, by crafting their own
             search URL, to search for bugs based using those
             fields as criteria, thus possibly exposing sensitive
             time-tracking information by a user seeing that a bug
             matched their search.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-1204


Class:       Local Information Disclosure
Versions:    3.5.1 to 3.6, 3.7
Fixed In:    3.6.1, 3.7.1
Description: If $use_suexec was set to "1" in the localconfig file,
             then the localconfig file's permissions were set as
             world-readable by checksetup.pl. This allowed any user
             with local shell access to see the contents of the file,
             including the database password and the site_wide_secret
             variable used for CSRF protection.
