Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers one security issue that has recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

* Bug reporters could confirm their bugs and change their bugs'
  statuses, even if they didn't have the appropriate permissions.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Unauthorized Bug Change
Versions:    3.1.1 through 3.2.3, 3.3.1 through 3.3.4
Fixed In:    3.2.4, 3.4rc1
Description: Users could, in some situations, confirm bugs even if they
             weren't in the canconfirm group, or set a bug to statuses
             that they normally didn't have access to. (For example,
             bug reporters who had no permissions could set their bug
             to any status, while they are only supposed to be able to
             close their bug.)
