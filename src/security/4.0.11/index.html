Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* The login form had no CSRF protection, meaning that an attacker could
  force the victim to log in using the attacker's credentials.

* Dangerous control characters can be inserted into Bugzilla, notably
  into bug comments, which can then be used to execute local commands.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.0 to 4.4.2, 4.5.1 to 4.5.2
Fixed In:    4.4.3, 4.5.3
Description: The login form had no CSRF protection, meaning that
             an attacker could force the victim to log in using the
             attacker's credentials. If the victim then reports a new
             security sensitive bug, the attacker would get immediate
             access to this bug.
             Due to changes involved in the Bugzilla API, this fix is
             not backported to the 4.0 and 4.2 branches, meaning that
             Bugzilla 4.0.12 and older, and 4.2.8 and older, will
             remain vulnerable to this issue.

CVE Number:  CVE-2014-1517

Class:       Social Engineering
Versions:    Bugzilla 2.0 to 4.0.11, 4.1.1 to 4.2.7, 4.3.1 to 4.4.2,
             4.5.1 to 4.5.2
Fixed In:    4.0.12, 4.2.8, 4.4.3, 4.5.3
Description: Dangerous control characters can be inserted into
             Bugzilla, notably into bug comments. If the text, which
             may look safe, is copied into a terminal such as xterm or
             gnome-terminal, then unexpected commands could be executed
             on the local machine.
