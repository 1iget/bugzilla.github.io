Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* It was possible to (at least partially) determine the membership
  of any group using the Search interface.

* It was possible to use the 'sudo' feature without sending
  a notification to the user being impersonated.

* The 'Reports' and 'Duplicates' pages let you guess the name of
  products you could not see, due to the error message that was
  thrown.

* For installations using PostgreSQL, specifying "bug X" or
  "attachment X" in a comment would deny access to the bug if X was
  larger than the maximum 32-bit signed integer size.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Versions:    2.19.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,
             3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: An unprivileged user is normally not allowed to view
             other users' group membership. But boolean charts
             let the user use group-based pronouns, indirectly
             disclosing group membership. This security fix
             restricts the use of pronouns to groups the user
             belongs to.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2756

Class:       Notification Bypass
Versions:    2.22rc1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,
             3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: Normally, when a user is impersonated, he receives
             an email informing him that he is being impersonated,
             containing the identity of the impersonator. However,
             it was possible to impersonate a user without this
             notification being sent.

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2757

Class:       Remote Information Disclosure
Versions:    2.17.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,
             3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: An error message thrown by the "Reports" and "Duplicates"
             page confirmed the non-existence of products, thus
             allowing users to guess confidential product names.
             (Note that the "Duplicates" page was not vulnerable
             in Bugzilla 3.6rc1 and above though.)

CVE Number:  CVE-2010-2758

Class:       Denial of Service
Versions:    2.23.1 to 3.2.7, 3.3.1 to 3.4.7, 3.5.1 to 3.6.1,
             3.7 to 3.7.2
Fixed In:    3.2.8, 3.4.8, 3.6.2, 3.7.3
Description: If a comment contained the phrases "bug X" or
             "attachment X", where X was an integer larger than the
             maximum 32-bit signed integer size, PostgreSQL would
             throw an error, and any page containing that comment would
             not be viewable. On most Bugzillas, any user can enter
             a comment on any bug, so any user could have used this to
             deny access to one or all bugs. Bugzillas running on
             databases other than PostgreSQL are not affected.
