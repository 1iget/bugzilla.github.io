<pre>
Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers one security issue that has recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

* The names of all products are exposed on show_bug.cgi to any user
  who can edit bugs, even products that are normally invisible
  to that user.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    3.3.4, 3.4rc1, 3.4
Fixed In:    3.4.1
Description: Normally, users are only supposed to see products that
             they can file bugs against in the "Product" drop-down
             on the bug-editing page. Instead, users were being shown
             all products, even those that they normally could not
             see. Any user who could edit any bug could see all product
             names.
