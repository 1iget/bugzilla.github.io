Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects.

* Aliases of hidden bugs would show up in the "Depends On" and "Blocks"
  list of other bugs, even if you didn't have permission to see the
  hidden bugs.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    3.3.2 to 3.4.3, 3.5 to 3.5.1
Fixed In:    3.4.4, 3.5.2
Description: When a bug is in a group, none of its information
             (other than its status and resolution) should be visible
             to users outside that group. It was discovered that
             as of 3.3.2, Bugzilla was showing the alias of the bug 
             (a very short string used as a shortcut for looking up
             the bug) to users outside of the group, if the protected
             bug ended up in the "Depends On" or "Blocks" list of any
             other bug.
