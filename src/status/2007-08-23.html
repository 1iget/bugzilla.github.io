<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>We've released several releases today, and lots of exciting things
  are happening in the world of Bugzilla development!</p>

<p>3.0 was very stable, but 3.0.1 has a lot of great polish fixes for the
  3.0 series, making it our best release ever.</p>

<p>3.1.1 has lots of new features, and you can read about it below,
  but it's <strong>very</strong> unstable. We found critical bugs in
  it right up to the moment of release, so you definitely should not
  use it in a production environment.</p>

<p>2.22.3 fixes some critical bugs in the 2.22 series. 2.20.5 fixes
  one critical bug.</p>

<p>All of the releases also contain security fixes, which you can
  read about in the <a href="../security/2.20.4/">Security Advisory</a>.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.1.1</h2>

<p>All of the other releases have release notes, but this one has lots
  of new features and no release notes! So here's some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>More fields in Atom-formatted bug lists.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla includes some microformats on show_bug.cgi and a few other
    places.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla is fully templatized now, with the templatization of
    <kbd>sanitycheck.cgi</kbd>.</li>
  <li>The UI for editing a group in <kbd>editgroups.cgi</kbd> got a major
    overhaul.</li>
  <li>You can save a column list with your Saved Searches now.</li>
  <li>You can specify multiple fail-over LDAP servers for authentication.</li>
  <li><kbd>process_bug.cgi</kbd> is in the middle of a major overhaul.
    Most of its code is being moved into <kbd>Bugzilla::Bug</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now uses InnoDB tables for MySQL.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now uses database transactions in several places.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now enforces referential integrity in several places
    at the database level.</li>
  <li>Even more of checksetup.pl is now localizable.</li>
  <li>checksetup.pl now prints out modules in the order they should be
    installed.</li>
  <li>The various administrative control panel links have been removed
    from the footer in favor of a single "Administration" link that goes
    to a new page that has links to all the various administrative 
    controls.</li>
  <li>You can expand/collapse comments when viewing a bug.</li>
  <li>You can limit the recursion level of dependency graphs, now.</li>
  <li>You can now customize bug statuses and their relationships.</li>
  <li>The "Help" system (usually seen on query.cgi) now should work
    in all browsers, not just Firefox.</li>
  <li>You can now see what Components a user is the Default Assignee
    or QA Contact of when you edit the user as an administrator.</li>
  <li>The Keywords box is now enhanced with JavaScript to make editing
    the field easier.</li>
  <li>You can now see how many users have subscribed to your Saved Search.</li>
  <li>If you have a bug in groups and you move it to another product,
    Bugzilla is now more friendly about asking you what groups you
    want the bug to be/remain in.</li>
  <li>If you have <kbd>usemenuforusers</kbd> turned on, Bugzilla will now
    show a drop-down box for flag requestees containing only people in the 
    grant group.</li>
  <li>Saved Searches now list what group they are shared to, in the list
    of searches you can select from.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now supports RADIUS authentication.</li>
  <li>You can now have icons placed next to users who are in certain
    groups.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now requires Perl 5.8.1 or newer.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now has a new look that you can choose with the "Dusk"
    skin.</li>
  <li>The [&#37;# 1.0@bugzilla.org &#37;] comments at the top of every template
    file have been removed, as we never used them for their intended
    purpose.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>languages</kbd> parameter has been removed. Bugzilla now
    just reads the contents of the <kbd>template/</kbd> directory
    to discover what languages are installed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember though that most of these features haven't received any testing
  at all! So they might not even work. But we encourage you to test
  this release and file bugs if you find things that are broken!</p>

<h2>Development Schedule for 3.2</h2>

<p>We've changed our schedule to accomodate our current development and
  our goals for Bugzilla 3.2.</p>

<p>Our "soft freeze" (where we don't accept new feature patches, but
  we will work on finishing up bugs that we currently have in progress)
  is tentatively planned for September 21, and our "hard freeze" (where
  we don't accept any new features at all) on October 2. 
  
<p>The more <a href="../contribute/">contributors</a> we get, particularly
  in the area of Release and QA, the faster we can get this release out
  when it's ready!</p>

<h2>Upcoming EOL of Bugzilla 2.20</h2>

<p>With the release of Bugzilla 3.2, the Bugzilla 2.20.x series will
  reach End Of Life, meaning that there won't be any further bug-fix updates,
  even if critical security issues are discovered.</p>

<p>We recommend that all Bugzilla 2.20 users upgrade to 3.0.1
  at their earliest convenience.
  <a href="../releases/3.0.1/release-notes.html#v30_upgrading">Upgrade
   instructions</a> are in the Bugzilla 3.0 Release Notes.</p>

<h2>New Contributor Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation for people who want to contribute to Bugzilla has
  been completely overhauled! Check out our 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Developers">new contributor
  documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
  This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
  invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugzilla Meetings</h2>

<p>Come to our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">meetings</a>
every month! Anybody is welcome to attend who is interested in helping
out with the Bugzilla Project, or just anybody who wants to put in their
two cents on how development should go.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the meetings at the 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">wiki page about 
  Bugzilla Meetings</a>.</p>
