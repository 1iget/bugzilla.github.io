<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>The Bugzilla Project has been making some really good progress
  lately. We've fixed all the oldest security bugs in Bugzilla with
  this set of releases, and we've also done a tremendous amount of
  feature development and general improvement work toward Bugzilla
  3.4.</p>

<p>The security fixes in this upgrade are worth reading about,
  since some functionality in your Bugzilla may change after
  this upgrade, depending on how you choose to configure certain
  parameters. See the <a href="../security/2.22.6/">Security
  Advisory</a> for Details.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.3.2</h2>

<p>Even though it's only been a few weeks, we've done a tremendous
  amount of development between 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.</p>

<p>The Bugzilla Project is especially thankful to 
  <a href="http://www.canonical.com/">Canonical</a>, who funded
  <a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">Everything Solved</a>
  to add a bunch of new WebServices functions and an exciting
  new "See Also" field where you can put the URLs to bugs in other
  Bugzilla installations.</p>

<p>There are lots more features than just those, though. Here's a
  summary of the major new enhancements in 3.3.2 since 3.3.1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Email addresses are now only displayed to logged-in users.</li>
  <li>Aliases are displayed instead of bug ids in the Depends On
    and Blocks lists, if the bugs have aliases.</li>
  <li>A "See Also" field that accepts URLs to Bugzilla bugs and
    Launchpad bugs, designed to allow you to refer to bugs in
    other installations. This won't be getting any new functionality
    for Bugzilla 3.4, but future releases will automatically update
    the other Bugzilla to let it know that you set a See Also.</li>
  <li>New WebService methods: Bug.update_see_also, Bug.search, 
    Bug.comments, Bugzilla.time</li>
  <li>The WebService Bug.get method now returns more fields.</li>
  <li>The WebService Bug.add_comment method now returns the comment_id
     of the added comment.</li>
  <li>More of Bugzilla now uses the shadow DB when possible.</li>
  <li>You now have the option to view more details information in
    time-tracking summary reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>And we expect Bugzilla 3.4 to have a few more new features than
  those, too.</li>

<p>The current estimated release date for Bugzilla 3.4 is May 15, 2009,
  although that's a very rough estimate and may change.</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
  This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
