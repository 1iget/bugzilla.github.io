<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>Today we have an unstable development release, Bugzilla 3.3.1. This
  is our first development snapshot toward Bugzilla 3.4. There aren't 
  any release notes yet for it, so we're just going to talk about the
  release here in the status update and highlight a few of the new
  features.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.3.1</h2>

<p>Bugzilla 3.3.1 has been under development for quite some time.
  We branched for 3.4 in May of 2008, but our main development
  focus was still 3.2 until it was released. So 3.4 got some occasional
  new features for a long time, and then a lot of enhancements recently,
  after we released 3.2.</p>

<p>Bugzilla 3.4 is going to be a time-based release, meaning that we're
  going to have a feature freeze on January 29 no matter how many
  features we have, or what the features look like. Hopefully this should
  allow us to release relatively quickly and have a Bugzilla 3.4 by May.</p>

<p>However, since we're freezing very soon, it's important that you let
  us know what you think about the new features! Either download the
  <a href="../download/#v34">new development release</a> or go check
  out the features using one of the "CVS" installations on
  <a href="https://landfill.bugzilla.org/">landfill</a>.</p>

<p>Here's a list of some of the new features in 3.3.1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Users can now choose what time zone to display times in.</li>
  <li>New custom field type: Bug ID</li>
  <li>You can now show or hide particular custom fields based on the value
    of another field.</li>
  <li>The list of values for a drop-down or multi-select custom field
    can now be different depending on the value of another field.</li>
  <li>When you do a search, you will now see a basic description of what
    you searched for at the top of the bug list.</li>
  <li>New WebService functions: Bug.get_history, User.get</li>
  <li>You can now update the dependency fields when changing several bugs
    at once.</li>
  <li>You can now use drop-down custom fields as axises in reports.</li>
  <li>There is now an email preference that allows you to receive mail
    when a bug is newly created.</li>
  <li>You can now see summarized timetracking data at the bottom of a
    bug list.</li>
  <li>You can now re-order the columns of a bug list.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now uses SHA-2 to store passwords in the database instead of
    the Unix crypt() function. This allows Bugzilla to recognize passwords
    longer than eight characters.</li>
  <li>Various parameters have been removed and replaced with Bugzilla
    behaving sensibly by default.</li>
  <li>The X-Bugzilla-Type header in bugmail now differentiates between 
    bugmails for new bugs and bug updates.</li>
  <li>You can now add private comments when changing several bugs at once.</li>
  <li>Abbreviated data in bug lists is shown fully in tooltips.</li>
  <li>When you run checksetup.pl, it will re-write your <kbd>localconfig</kbd>
    file, update the comments, and remove any old variables automatically.</li>
  <li>If you try to put an invalid regular expression into any field that
    accepts a regex, Bugzilla will now throw an error instead of just
    failing on the database side.</li>
</ul>
