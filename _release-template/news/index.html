<p>FIXME-INTRO</p>

[% IF security %]
  <p>All of today's releases contain security fixes. We recommend that all
    Bugzilla administrators read the
    <a href="../security/[% security %]/">Security Advisory</a> that was
    published along with these releases.</p>

[% IF rc %]
  <p><a href="../releases/[% rc FILTER branch %]/">Bugzilla [% rc %]</a> is
    our FIXME Release Candidate for Bugzilla [% rc FILTER branch %]. This
    release has received QA testing, and should be considerably more stable
    than the development releases before it. It is still not considered
    fully stable, and so you should understand that if you use it, you use
    it at your own risk.</p>

  <p>If feedback from this release candidate indicates that it is mostly
    stable, then Bugzilla [% rc FILTER branch %] will be released in a few
    weeks. If feedback indicates that more extensive fixes are needed, there
    may be another release candidate after this one.</p>

    is an unstable development release. This release has not received QA
    testing from the Bugzilla Project, and should not be used in production
    environments. Development releases exist as previews of the features that
    the next major release of Bugzilla will contain. They also exist for
    testing purposes, to collect bug reports and feedback, so if you find
    a bug in this development release (or you don't like how some feature
    works) please <a href="../developers/reporting_bugs.html">tell us</a>.</p>

  <p>For details on what's new in this development release and what's going 
    on with the Bugzilla Project, see our latest
    <a href="../status/FIXME.html">Status Update</a>.</p>
