Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* The 'realname' parameter is not correctly filtered on user account
  creation, which could lead to user data override.
* Several places were found in the Bugzilla code where cross-site
  scripting attacks could be used to access sensitive information.
* Private comments can be shown to flagmail recipients who aren't in
  the insider group
* Specially formatted values in a CSV search results export could be
  used in spreadsheet software to attack a user's computer.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details

Class:       Unauthorized Account Creation
Versions:    2.23.3 to 4.0.14, 4.1.1 to 4.2.10, 4.3.1 to 4.4.5, 4.5.1 to 4.5.5
Fixed In:    4.0.15, 4.2.11, 4.4.6, 4.5.6
Description: An attacker creating a new Bugzilla account can override certain

             requested. The overridden login name could be automatically added
             to groups based on the group's regular expression setting.
