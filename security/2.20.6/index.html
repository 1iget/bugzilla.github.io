Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers a minor security issue that has recently been fixed
in the Bugzilla code:

* Unprivileged users can approve/unapprove all quips

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Manipulation of Data
Versions:    2.17.4 and higher
Description: Quips, which are displayed at the top of bug lists, can be
             suggested by all users, but administrators can control which
             ones to display. By using a well crafted URL, unprivileged
             users can bypass access checks and approve or disapprove
             quips themselves.
