<h1>4.4rc1, 4.2.4, 4.0.9, and 3.6.12 Security Advisory</h1>
Tuesday Feb 19th, 2013<br/>

Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system used by a large number of
software projects. The following security issues have been discovered
in Bugzilla:

* When viewing a bug report, a bug ID containing random code is not
  correctly sanitized in the HTML page if the specified page format
  is invalid. This can lead to XSS.

* When running a query in debug mode, it is possible to determine if
  a given confidential field value (such as a product name) exists.
  Bugzilla 4.1 and newer are not affected by this issue.

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.


Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Scripting
Versions:    2.0 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9, 4.1.1 to 4.2.4,
             4.3.1 to 4.4rc1
Fixed In:    3.6.13, 4.0.10, 4.2.5, 4.4rc2
Description: When viewing a single bug report, which is the default,
             the bug ID is validated and rejected if it is invalid.
             But when viewing several bug reports at once, which is
             specified by the format=multiple parameter, invalid bug
             IDs can go through and are sanitized in the HTML page
             itself. But when an invalid page format is passed to the
             CGI script, the wrong HTML page is called and data are not
             correctly sanitized, which can lead to XSS.

CVE Number:  CVE-2013-0785

Class:       Information Leak
Versions:    2.17.1 to 3.6.12, 3.7.1 to 4.0.9
Fixed In:    3.6.13, 4.0.10
Description: When running a query in debug mode, the generated SQL
             query used to collect the data is displayed. The way this
             SQL query is built permits the user to determine if some
             confidential field value (such as a product name) exists.
             This problem only affects Bugzilla 4.0.9 and older. Newer
             releases are not affected by this issue.
