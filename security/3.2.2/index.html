<h1>3.2.2 and 3.3.3 Security Advisory</h1>
March 30, 2009<br/>
<pre>
Summary
=======

Bugzilla is a Web-based bug-tracking system, used by a large number of
software projects.

This advisory covers one security issue that has recently been
fixed in the Bugzilla code:

* Attachment editing was vulnerable to a cross-site request forgery.
  Note that this issue was only fixed for 3.2.3 and 3.3.4 even though
  all versions of Bugzilla are affected (see below for an explanation).

All affected installations are encouraged to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Vulnerability Details
=====================

Class:       Cross-Site Request Forgery
Versions:    Every version before 3.2.3 or 3.3.4
Fixed In:    3.2.3, 3.3.4
Description: Attachment editing was vulnerable to a cross-site request
             forgery, because it did not validate that calls to
             attachment.cgi actually came from Bugzilla.

             Bugzilla now generates a token that is validated when
             an attachment is edited. Unfortunately, a fix for this issue
             was only possible for 3.2.3 and 3.3.4. Fixing it on earlier
             branches was not possible as attachment timestamps are not
             available to generate and validate tokens.
