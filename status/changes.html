<h1>Bugzilla Changelog</h1>

<p>
You can now get a list of changes in Bugzilla between any two particular points
in our development using
<a href="https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/compare/">Github's
difference interface</a>. Select the before and after points you want
using the controls at the top of the page. By default, the controls list
every branch, but not every tag.</p>

<p>Every Bugzilla release (and there are many) is tagged
with a name equal to the string "release-" followed by
the version number. So, for example, to see the differences between 4.4.8 and 4.4.12, you
would end up
<a href="https://github.com/bugzilla/bugzilla/compare/release-4.4.8...release-4.4.12">here</a>.</p>
