<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>

<p><strong>Friday, February 1, 2008</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>When we released 3.0.3, Bugzilla 3.1.3 wasn't quite ready to release.
  But today, few weeks after the 3.0.3 all the features we wanted for this
  development release are ready, and so we're releasing today!</p>

<p>3.1.3 has lots of new features as you can read about it below,
  but it's still unstable, so you definitely should not use it in a 
  production environment.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.1.3</h2>

<p>Here are some highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bugzilla now has <strong>experimental</strong> support for Oracle
    databases. Please note that you cannot currently upgrade an Oracle
    database. That is, if you install Bugzilla on Oracle, you will have
    to drop the entire database to upgrade to any new version. This will
    <em>probably</em> be fixed before the final release of 3.2.</li>
  <li>The user interface for editing bugs has been redesigned. It will be
    even better in the final release of Bugzilla 3.2.</li>
  <li>Huge performance and memory improvements for mod_perl users (same
    fix that was in 3.0.3.)</li>
  <li>Incoming bugmail is now converted to UTF-8.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now uses transactions instead of locking the 
    database tables.</li>
  <li>Various LDAP handling improvements.</li>
  <li>Plugins can now extend the Webservice interface.</li>
  <li>There's now a tool to auto-install missing Perl packages on non-Windows
      systems. It can install to a local directory, so you don't even have
      to be root or modify your system's Perl installation.</li>
  <li>Mid-Air Collision protection for attachments.</li>
  <li>Many useless intermediate pages have been removed, especially in 
    admin pages.</li>
  <li>You can now add comments to bugs using XML-RPC.</li>
  <li>New custom field type: Date/Time field, with a JavaScript widget
    for picking a date.</li>
  <li>You can now reverse the sort of a buglist by clicking on a header 
    twice.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla's support for multi-byte languages has greatly improved.
    We did this by making Bugzilla treat strings as "characters" instead
    of as "bytes."</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, if you've ever looked at the code for <kbd>process_bug.cgi</kbd>,
  we encourage you to look at its code in this new release and see how
  different it is!</p>

<p>We encourage you to test this release and file bugs if you find things that
   are broken!</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>The documentation has been improved: many new sections that were missing
   were added and most of the user interface pages have now links towards the
   appropriate section.</p>

<h2>The New User Experience Team</h2>

<p>Bugzilla now has a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:UE">User
  Experience Team</a> that focuses on improving Bugzilla's user interface
  and the general experience that users have. If you're interested in
  helping out, email the team leader, 
  <a href="mailto:guy.pyrzak&#64;gmail.com">Guy Pyrzak</a>!</p>

<h2>The New Localization Team</h2>

<p>Bugzilla now has <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:L10N">a team
  of contributors that focuses on making Bugzilla easier to localize</a>.
  They are currently researching what things need to be done to improve 
  Bugzilla's localizability. The team's coordinator is Vitaly Fedrushkov
  from Russia (SnowyOwl on IRC). If you are interested in helping out,
  let him know on IRC, or let one of the Bugzilla developers know and
  they will pass it on to him.</p>

<h2>FAQ Moved to the Wiki</h2>

<p>For the Bugzilla 3.2 documentation, we've decided to move the
  Bugzilla FAQ onto <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla">our wiki</a>.
  You can see it here: 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:FAQ">Bugzilla:FAQ</a>.
  We encourage any experienced Bugzilla administrators to look over the
  current questions, make sure they're up to date, and add any new
  questions that need to be added!</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
  This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
  invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a>.
  You might also want to contribute to other
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Bugzilla:Teams">Bugzilla areas</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugzilla Meetings</h2>

<p>Come to our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">meetings</a>
every month! Anybody is welcome to attend who is interested in helping
out with the Bugzilla Project, or just anybody who wants to put in their
two cents on how development should go.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the meetings at the 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">wiki page about 
  Bugzilla Meetings</a>.</p>
