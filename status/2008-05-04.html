<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>
CÃ©dric Corazza and
<a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html">The Bugzilla Team</a>
<p><strong>Sunday, May 4, 2008</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>We've released four releases today: 3.0.4, 3.1.4, 2.22.4 and 2.20.6</p>

<p>A few security vulnerabilities were discovered in the four branches
  which you can read about in the
  <a href="../security/2.20.5/">Security Advisory</a>.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.1.4</h2>

<p>3.1.4 is a lot more stable than 3.1.3 was, but it's still not a
  final release, so we don't recommend using it in a production environment.
  In particular, anybody using Oracle with Bugzilla should be extremely
  cautious about using this version of Bugzilla.</p>

<p>Here are a few significant enhancements in this release compared 
  to 3.1.3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The bug editing form has been redesigned.</li>
  <li>Using 'Test' in mail_delivery_method now generates valid mbox file so
    you can easily perform QA tests.</li>
  <li>Bugmail threading in email clients has been enhanced.</li>
  <li>SMTP authentication is now supported.</li>
  <li>A user who has product-specific editbugs privileges for all
   bugs listed in a bug list can now use the "Change several bugs at once" link
   to do mass-changes.</li>
  <li>Custom fields can now be deleted if they have never been used.</li>
  <li>More and more of Bugzilla now works correctly with multi-byte
    languages. Also, many UTF-8 problems from 3.1.3 have been fixed.</li>
  <li>There have been various performance improvements in database access.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage you to test this release and file bugs if you find things that
   are broken!</p>

<p>Our next development release should be 3.2 RC1, with an estimated release
  date in the second quarter of 2008. Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Bugzilla 2.20 Series End of Life</h2>

<p>We would warn you that Bugzilla 2.20 series will soon reach End Of Life,
  meaning that no future security or bug fixes will be issued for 2.20
  installations. We strongly advise Bugzilla administrators to upgrade 
  their installations to version 3.0.4.</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
