<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>
<a href="http://www.everythingsolved.com/">Max Kanat-Alexander</a> and
<a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/developers/profiles.html">The Bugzilla Team</a>
<p><strong>Wednesday, May 9, 2007</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>After quite a bit of work, we've released 
  <a href="../releases/3.0">Bugzilla 3.0</a>! You can go read
  <a href="../news/#release30">the release announcement</a> for more 
  details.</p>

<p>There's also various other interesting news in Bugzilla land,
  see below for details.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.0</h2>

<p>Bugzilla 3.0 is very stable--we've had a long stabilizing cycle, 
  3.0rc1 got a lot of testing, and this release has been through our 
  extensive QA process.</p>

<p>It has lots of <a href="../releases/3.0/new-features.html">new features</a>.
  And, of course, we think you should read the 
  <a href="../releases/3.0/release-notes.html">release notes</a>, because
  hey, they're really useful! (And I spent a lot of time working on them!)
  (They're even in HTML now, which is pretty cool.)</p>

<h2>Future Releases</h2>

<p>We've already done a lot of hacking away in terms of rearchitecture
  and adding new features toward 3.1, so 3.2 should be a very exciting
  release.</p>

<p>In general, having a good QA process has made us have to release
  far fewer bug-fix releases. The 2.22 series has been extremely stable, and
  so we expect the 3.0 series to be extremely stable as well.</p>

<h2>Roadmap for Bugzilla 3.2</h2>

<p>We have a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Roadmap">roadmap for
  Bugzilla 3.2</a> that goes over the major new features we'd like to implement
  for 3.2. As you can see, there are a lot of new features there, and we'd love
  any help that we can get!</p>

<h2>Development Schedule for 3.2</h2>

<p>By our standard schedule, development for Bugzilla 3.2 enters a 
  "soft freeze" on August 21 (where we don't accept new feature patches, but
  we will work on finishing up bugs that we currently have in progress), and
  a "hard freeze" (where we don't accept any new features) on September 4.</p>

<p>The more <a href="../contribute/">contributors</a> we get, particularly
  in the area of Release and QA, the faster we can get this release out
  when it's ready!</p>

<h2>EOL of Bugzilla 2.18</h2>

<p>We sent out the EOL announcement for Bugzilla 2.18, so users of 
  Bugzilla 2.18 or 2.18.x should now all know that there won't be any
  new releases in the 2.18 series, even if there are security bugs discovered
  in a 2.18 release. 

<p>We recommend that all Bugzilla 2.18 users upgrade to 3.0,
  at their earliest convenience.
  <a href="../releases/3.0/release-notes.html#v30_upgrading">Upgrade instructions</a>
  are in the Bugzilla 3.0 Release Notes.</p>

<h2>Updated "Features" Page</h2>

<p>For a while, the <a href="../features/">features page</a> had been
  out-of-date, reflecting the features of Bugzilla 2.18. Now it's fully
  up-to-date with all of the features of Bugzilla 3.0, and it's
  pretty impressive! If you need help "selling" Bugzilla at your organization,
  feel free to point people at the updated features page!</p>

<h2>T-Shirt for 3000th Announce List Subscriber</h2>

<p>We sent a free Bugzilla t-shirt to the 3000th subscriber to our
  announcement list, Rich Gibbs. 3000 subscribers to the announce
  list shows a <em>huge</em> increase in the number of subscribers
  in just the past year. Despite there being more and more bug-trackers
  on the market, Bugzilla is still gaining in popularity!</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
  This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
  invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/contributor.html">Contributor's Guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Bugzilla Meetings</h2>

<p>Come to our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">meetings</a>
every month! Anybody is welcome to attend who is interested in helping
out with the Bugzilla Project, or just anybody who wants to put in their
two cents on how development should go.</p>

<p>You can learn more about the meetings at the 
  <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">wiki page about 
  Bugzilla Meetings</a>.</p>
