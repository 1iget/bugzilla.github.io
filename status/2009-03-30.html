<h1>Bugzilla Status Update</h1>

<p><strong>Monday, March 30, 2009</strong></p>

<h2>Introduction and Updates</h2>

<p>We released two versions of Bugzilla today. Bugzilla 3.2.3 has some
  important bug fixes, and Bugzilla 3.3.4 is our latest development 
  snapshot.</p>

<h2>About Bugzilla 3.3.4</h2>

<p>Bugzilla 3.3.4 is our latest development release leading up to 
  Bugzilla 3.4. Bugzilla 3.3.4 is feature-complete. This means that from 
  here on out until the final release of Bugzilla 3.4, we will only be fixing
  bugs on the 3.4 branch--we won't be adding any new features.</p>

<p>Bugzilla 3.3.4 is still unstable, and should not be used in production
  environments. There are still known bugs that have not been fixed, in this
  release.</p>

<p>There have been a few big changes since Bugzilla 3.3.3:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is a brand-new super-simple front page for Bugzilla.</li>
  <li>The form for filing a bug is now much simpler by default.</li>
  <li>Obsolete attachments are now hidden by default, on a bug.</li>
  <li>You can now log in using a form in the header and footer on every
    page in Bugzilla.</li>
  <li>When editing a bug, text inputs grow with your browser window.</li>
  <li>When you log out of Bugzilla, you will be sent to the front page, not
    just a blank page with a message saying you've logged out.</li>
  <li>The <code>Bug.get</code> WebService function now accepts a "permissive"
    argument that can be used to make it not die on errors.</li>
  <li>You can now have custom fields only show up in a particular product.</li>
</ul>

<p>Development for Bugzilla 3.4 is now done on the 
  <strong><code>BUGZILLA-3_4-BRANCH</code></strong> branch in CVS instead of
  on trunk. So if you are updating via CVS, make sure to do 
  <code>cvs -q up -dP -r BUGZILLA-3_4-BRANCH</code> when updating, if you
  want to stay on the 3.4 branch.</p>

<p>The trunk (<code>HEAD</code>) is open for feature development toward
  Bugzilla 3.6.</p>

<h2>Stay Updated About Bugzilla</h2>

<p>As usual, we'd like to remind all Bugzilla administrators that to assist
  them in keeping up-to-date with release announcements and security
  advisories, we provide an ultra-low-volume administrator mailing list
  (<a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-full-long&amp;extra=announce">announce@bugzilla.org</a>). 
  We advise all Bugzilla administrators to subscribe so they can keep up 
  with important Bugzilla announcements.</p>

<p>Those looking to get involved with Bugzilla development may want to
  consider joining the <a href="https://lists.bugzilla.org/cgi-bin/mj_wwwusr?func=lists-long-full&amp;extra=developers">developers list (developers@bugzilla.org)</a>.
  This list offers discussion on new features and issues. Developers are
  invited to subscribe to the list. You may also want to read our

<h2>Bugzilla Meetings</h2>

<p>Come to our <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Meetings">meetings</a>
every month! Anybody is welcome to attend who is interested in helping
out with the Bugzilla Project, or just anybody who wants to put in their
two cents on how development should go.</p>
